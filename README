This is a Prototyp implementation.

This python module provides accsess to the LPC11C24 CAN ISP.

# Read firmware:
 $python read filename

# Write firmware:
 $python read filename

# Execute binary from RAM:
 $python exec filename


In loader you find two binary:
 * reset.bin to reset the MCU after flashing the firmware
 * soft_reset to jump into the application in flash
   This is needed in case you jumpered the Boot0/Bootsel pin

 $python exec loader/reset.bin
 $python exec loader/soft_reset.bin
