This is a Prototyp implementation.

This python module provides accsess to the LPC11C24 CAN ISP.

# Setup
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install canopen
```

# Read firmware:
 $python can_isp.py read filename

# Write firmware:
 $python can_isp.py write filename

# Execute binary from RAM:
 $python can_isp.py exec filename


In loader you find two binary:
 * reset.bin to reset the MCU after flashing the firmware
 * soft_reset to jump into the application in flash
   This is needed in case you jumpered the Boot0/Bootsel pin

 $python can_isp.py exec loader/reset.bin
 $python can_isp.py exec loader/soft_reset.bin

# Reboot into bootloader

If the user code is already running and it uses our bootloader endpoint, you can reboot it into bootloader mode with.

```
python invoke_isp.py
```

Please note that the will switch every node on the CAN bus into bootloader mode.So make sure you have only one connected.
